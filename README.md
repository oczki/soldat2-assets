# Soldat 2 custom image assets

This is a collection of custom assets related to Soldat 2 &ndash; like ranks, weapons and mode icons.

- **Ranks** (128&times;128 px)
    - Original images were made by proto.
    - I modified some shapes (e.g. Silver III top is now symmetrical), darkened the stripes and enlarged them, so that the ranks are more distinguishable when resized down.
    - I got permission from proto to upload these here as derivative work.
- **Weapons** (328&times;128 px)
    - Original images were taken from the game and sent to me by darDar.
    - I cleaned up the edges, recolored, fixed some details like the chainsaw's blades, and added outlines.
- **Gamemodes** (128&times;128 px)
    - Original images by me, drawn in Figma as vectors.
    - Let me know if you need these without outlines or in higher resolution.
